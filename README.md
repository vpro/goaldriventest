2. **Feedback at Every Step:** As the AI navigates, it provides valuable insights, detailing its expectations and pointing out potential areas that could frustrate users.
   
3. **Simulated User Interactions:** One of the standout features of GoalQuestAI is its ability to mimic various target audience behaviors. This lets website developers and designers gain insights into how different types of users might interact with and experience their website.
